#we are Hiding Implementation of the complex code , so itâ€™s simple to use by calling the interface 
#Well structured , Follow Rules So we avoid error in implementing the methods 
      
# Eg - Car we see break, gear but the implementation for each Brands. Its different Abstract class helps us to Hide each brand Implementation by providing an Interface .
